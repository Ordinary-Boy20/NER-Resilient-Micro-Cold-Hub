# NER-Resilient Micro Cold Hub

A MATLAB/Simulink thermal-resilience model for a decentralized micro cold-storage system designed for North-Eastern Region (NER) agricultural aggregation.

## Project objective

The project investigates whether thermal buffering using an A13 phase-change material (PCM) can reduce produce-chamber temperature rise when active refrigeration fails.

The model focuses on **failure resilience and low downtime**, rather than treating solar power or IoT monitoring alone as the innovation.

## Current simulation case

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---:|
| Chamber volume | 30 L |
| Insulation | 40 mm PUF |
| Ambient temperature | 35 °C |
| Initial chamber temperature | 13 °C |
| Green banana load | 3 kg |
| Banana specific heat used | 3.86 kJ/kg·K |
| Banana-to-chamber UA | 3 W/K |
| Nominal cooling capacity in model | 70 W |
| Thermostat band | 12.5–13.5 °C |
| Compressor failure | 12 h |
| Failure duration tested | 6 h |
| PCM | PlusICE A13 |
| A13 latent heat | 225 kJ/kg |
| A13 nominal phase-change temperature | 13 °C |

## Model architecture

The chamber energy balance is:

C_ch dT_ch/dt = Q_wall + Q_banana - Q_PCM - Q_cool

The model contains:

- Ambient-to-chamber wall heat gain
- Dynamic green-banana thermal model
- Thermostatic refrigeration control
- Compressor failure event
- A13 PCM thermal-buffer subsystem
- PCM enthalpy/state-of-charge representation
- Chamber temperature logging
- With-PCM vs without-PCM comparison

## Failure-resilience result

For the current 6-hour compressor-failure simulation:

- With A13 PCM: **14.8727 °C** at the end of the test
- Without PCM: **18.1353 °C** at the end of the test
- Final-temperature reduction: **3.2626 °C**

Both cases remain below 15 °C during this particular 6-hour test, so this repository does **not** claim a 15 °C crossing-time advantage for the current run.

### Interpretation

The validated result demonstrates that A13 PCM acts as a **thermal buffer** during compressor failure. It does not represent electrical backup. Electrical resilience is a separate system layer involving PV, battery, energy management and refrigeration.

## How to reproduce the comparison

1. Open `MATLAB/Simulink/NER_Cold_Hub_A13_PCM.slx` in MATLAB/Simulink.
2. Run the model with the A13 PCM connected.
3. Save the resulting `Tchamber` timeseries as `PCM_data`.
4. Bypass the Q_PCM contribution at the chamber heat-balance sum.
5. Run the same model again without PCM.
6. Save the resulting `Tchamber` timeseries as `noPCM_data`.
7. Run `MATLAB/scripts/failure_comparison.m`.

The two cases must be separate simulation runs. Two logging blocks connected to the same Tchamber signal do not create independent PCM/no-PCM experiments.

## Software

- MATLAB R2025a
- Simulink

## Project status

**Current stage:** thermal/failure-resilience simulation validated for the 30 L design case.

Future work can add:

- PV generation model
- MPPT
- battery state-of-charge
- intelligent energy management
- compressor-current fault detection
- door-open fault detection
- recovery logic
- physical prototype validation
- longer-duration energy/autonomy analysis

## Engineering note

The current simulation is a lumped thermal model intended for system-level validation. Parameters such as heat-transfer coefficients, refrigeration performance, PCM packaging and thermal contact resistance should be experimentally validated before commercial-scale claims are made.
